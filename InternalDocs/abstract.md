# DriftOps - Project Abstract

## Overview

DriftOps is a comprehensive drift detection and management system designed to monitor and track infrastructure changes across cloud environments. The project focuses on identifying configuration drift in Terraform-managed infrastructure, providing real-time insights and automated remediation capabilities.

## Purpose

The primary goal of DriftOps is to:
- Detect configuration drift in cloud infrastructure
- Provide visibility into unauthorized or untracked changes
- Enable automated drift remediation
- Maintain infrastructure compliance and security posture
- Support multiple cloud providers and infrastructure tools

## Key Components

### Core Services
- **Drift Detection Engine**: Monitors infrastructure state and compares against desired configuration
- **Provider Integrations**: Supports multiple cloud providers and infrastructure platforms
- **Storage Layer**: Maintains historical drift data and configuration snapshots
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for drift management operations

### Infrastructure
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment for easy scaling
- **Kubernetes Ready**: Helm charts for orchestrated deployments
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for programmatic access

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform integration
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Documentation**: MDX-based documentation system

## Architecture

_(To be expanded with architecture diagrams)_

## Future Roadmap

- Architecture diagrams and visual documentation
- Detailed component interaction flows
- Security and compliance frameworks
- Integration guides and examples
