# DriftOps

DriftOps is a pre-deployment infrastructure drift detector that compares
Terraform plans with the actual live cloud infrastructure state.

Unlike traditional drift tools that detect issues after deployment,
DriftOps identifies drift before changes are applied, helping teams
prevent unsafe or unintended infrastructure modifications.
